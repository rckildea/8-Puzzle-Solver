# 8 Puzzle Solver
Takes a text representation of a traditional 8 Puzzle(s) and finds a solution (defined as the image below) or discovers the puzzle is unsolveable.  This program uses a breadth-first search to find a valid solution, and keeps track of visited states using a set.  I wrote this program for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class.
